# Behavioral Design Patterns in TypeScript

Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects, defining clear and flexible ways for them to interact while maintaining loose coupling.

This repository contains implementations of the following behavioral patterns:

- [Chain of Responsibility](#chain-of-responsibility)
- [Command](#command)
- [Mediator](#mediator)
- [Observer](#observer)
- [State](#state)
- [Strategy](#strategy)

---

## Chain of Responsibility

The **Chain of Responsibility** pattern allows multiple handlers to process a request, passing it along the chain until a handler processes it or the chain ends.

### Example

- [Chain of Responsibility Implementation](./chain_of_responsibility.ts)
- [Chain of Responsibility Tests](./__tests__/chain_of_responsibility.test.ts)

### JavaScript/TypeScript Pitfalls and Tips

#### Pitfalls:

1. **Skipping the Next Handler**:

   - Ensure each handler calls `super.handle(request)` if it does not process the request.

2. **Overcomplicating the Chain**:
   - Excessive handlers can make debugging difficult.

#### Tips:

1. Use TypeScriptâ€™s **abstract classes** to provide default handler behavior.
2. Keep handlers focused on a **single responsibility**.
3. Test different chain configurations to ensure flexibility.

## Command

The **Command** pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization, queuing, and undo functionality.

### Example

- [Command Implementation](./command.ts)
- [Command Tests](./__tests__/command.test.ts)

### JavaScript/TypeScript Pitfalls and Tips

#### Pitfalls:

1. **Forgetting Undo Mechanism**:

   - A command pattern should generally provide an undo function to reverse actions.

2. **Overcomplicating Simple Operations**:
   - If commands do not require history or undo, consider using a simpler approach.

#### Tips:

1. Store command **history** only if undo is needed.
2. Keep commands **stateless** where possible to improve reusability.

## Mediator

The **Mediator** pattern centralizes communication between objects to reduce direct dependencies and promote loose coupling.

### Example

- [Mediator Implementation](./mediator.ts)
- [Mediator Tests](./__tests__/mediator.test.ts)

### JavaScript/TypeScript Pitfalls and Tips

#### Pitfalls:

1. **Bypassing the Mediator**:

   - Direct communication between objects defeats the purpose of the pattern.

2. **Overcomplicating the Mediator**:
   - The mediator should coordinate, not implement business logic.

#### Tips:

1. Use **interfaces** to enforce communication contracts.
2. Ensure the mediator does not become a **God Object** by doing too much.

## Observer

The **Observer** pattern defines a dependency where multiple objects listen for changes to a subject and react accordingly.

### Example

- [Observer Implementation](./observer.ts)
- [Observer Tests](./__tests__/observer.test.ts)

### JavaScript/TypeScript Pitfalls and Tips

#### Pitfalls:

1. **Memory Leaks**:

   - Forgetting to detach observers can cause memory issues in dynamic systems.

2. **Overloading Notify Loops**:
   - Ensure notifications are not expensive operations.

#### Tips:

1. Use **weak references** (if supported) to prevent memory leaks.
2. Test with **multiple observers** to confirm correct notification handling.

---

## State

The **State** pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, encapsulating different behaviors into separate classes.

### Example

- [State Implementation](./state.ts)
- [State Tests](./__tests__/state.test.ts)

### JavaScript/TypeScript Pitfalls and Tips

#### Pitfalls:

1. **Forgetting to Update the State**:

   - Ensure `setState` is used when transitioning between states.

2. **Overcomplicating State Transitions**:
   - Keep transitions predictable and avoid unnecessary complexity.

#### Tips:

1. Use **interfaces** to enforce state consistency.
2. Ensure state transitions remain **clear and maintainable**.

---

## Strategy

The **Strategy** pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

### Example

- [Strategy Implementation](./strategy.ts)
- [Strategy Tests](./__tests__/strategy.test.ts)

### JavaScript/TypeScript Pitfalls and Tips

#### Pitfalls:

1. **Hardcoding Strategies**:

   - Avoid embedding strategy-specific logic directly in the context class.

2. **Unused Strategies**:
   - Adding too many strategies without practical use cases can make maintenance harder.

#### Tips:

1. Use **TypeScript interfaces** to enforce a common strategy contract.
2. Keep the context **flexible enough** to change strategies dynamically.

## Conclusion: Tips for Using Behavioral Patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript

1. **Leverage TypeScript**:

   - Use interfaces and types to define clear contracts between components.

2. **Avoid Overengineering**:

   - Use behavioral patterns when they provide a clear benefit, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

3. **Focus on Maintainability**:

   - Keep implementations modular and testable for long-term sustainability.

4. **Test Extensively**:
   - Ensure pattern implementations handle different scenarios and interactions properly.
